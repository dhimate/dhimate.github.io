I use photochromic lenses to help protect my eyes from the bright sunlight. These lenses turn dark when exposed to sunlight or high temperature. With this pair, my optician gave me a &lsquo;Certificate of Authenticity&rsquo; card from this company called &lsquo;Transitions&rsquo;. Transitions provide the photochromic feature in the lenses. I wasn&rsquo;t aware of them. Anyway, this certificate requested that I should register my purchase. I can&rsquo;t figure out why I should do this, and what&rsquo;s the downside of not registering. This also got me confused on many fronts. My last 4 pairs purchased from the same optician had photochromic lenses. Yet, I never got a certificate of authenticity. Does it mean those were inauthentic photochromic lenses? What would happen if I continue wearing them? Is this a new program to certify authentic lenses? Is there a spread of inauthentic lenses that the company is trying to contain?</p><figure><img src=/img/2021/certificate-of-authenticity/certificate.jpg alt=dwarf width=400px></figure><p>Whatever it might be. I am curious to understand how did this &lsquo;Certificate of Authenticity&rsquo; program launch? What&rsquo;s the strategy? What could be the end goal? Is it to increase brand awareness? That is one possibility. Even though my last 4 pairs had photochromic lenses, I never asked for a specific brand. Now I know about a product, which guarantees the authenticity of photochromic lenses. The next time I am ready for new glasses, should I insist on this specific brand? It is authentic. I know now! Or is it a desperate attempt to capture my contact information? So they can send me targeted advertisements? I looked at the registration page. It asked for my name, address, email, date of birth, gender(!), and other information. At least they didn&rsquo;t ask for my phone number! (Do they already have it?)</p><p>Another interesting question is, how does it relate to Crizal - my go-to lens brand? My lense says it&rsquo;s from Crizal! Then why do I have this certificate from Transitions? My cursory check on the internet shows that these are two different companies. Does Crizal provide the physical lens? And Transitions provide some sort of mechanism (sticker or a chemical?) to turn the lense dark when exposed to sunlight? Or is it the other way round where Transitions provide the color-changing physical lense, and Crizal provides an anti-reflective, anti-scratch coating on it?</p><p>This innocent little card has raised a lot of questions in my mind.</p></article><article><header><p class=meta>Mar 6, 2021

It was the busiest month I ever had. Our baby girl decided to arrive earlier than expected. Due to the pandemic, we decided to manage baby things on our own, without our parents. It&rsquo;s fun, but for the first time parents like us, it&rsquo;s not easy. The most difficult part is baby can&rsquo;t talk and exactly tell us what she wants yet. So we have to decipher her crying. Decoding her crying is like solving a puzzle. Is the diper wet, or poopy? Is she hungry? Or too full and needs to burp? But we just burped few mins ago. Is she too cold or too warm? Or just plain bored? The first few weeks I took a brute force approach and tried everything to soothe her. It worked but it was very inefficient (and exhausting). After a couple of more weeks, we got a hang of it and somewhat able to understand what she wants. (or she has given up on our parenting :)). The interesting thing about parenting is that everyone else has an opinion, and it usually comes down to how we are doing it wrong. ;) I learned to ignore it for the most part. I think nobody knows what they are doing, so it&rsquo;s just figuring out on the go.</p><p>Anyways, here is a funny anecdote. We were visiting the doctor for regular checkups over the last year. On our first visit to the hospital, the nurse told us to &lsquo;go downstairs to the lab&rsquo; for the blood checkup. Downstairs I noticed something interesting. There was no lab to be found. At least not easily. There were at least 4 other offices, each of them telling me that &lsquo;it&rsquo;s not a lab&rsquo;. The notice on one door told me that the lab was down the hall. But the Y shaped hallway had 3 corners to go.<figure><img src=/img/2021/not-lab-1.jpeg alt=dwarf width=600px></figure><figure><img src=/img/2021/not-lab-2.jpeg alt=dwarf width=600px></figure></p><p>After walking across all the hallways on that floor for 8-10 minutes, we finally located the lab in one remote corner. I guess we were just unlucky to pick the wrong hallways first. This bad &lsquo;UX&rsquo; could&rsquo;ve been easily avoided by simply putting a small arrow in the direction of the lab.</p><p>Whenever I am near the hospital, I feel I should go inside the building and put an arrow to show where the lab is.</p></article><div class=pagination><a href=/ aria-label=First class=label-pagination><i class="fa fa-angle-double-left fa-lg"></i></a>
