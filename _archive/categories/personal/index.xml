We often visited &amp;lsquo;internet cafes&amp;rsquo; to eletronically connect to the world by paying 10 Rs/hr.
The &amp;lsquo;free&amp;rsquo; supply of internet connectivity opened world of enterntainment opportunities for us. We used email to share jokes, and memes.</description></item><item><title>Solving Absurd Trolley Problems</title><link>https://www.dhimate.com/2022/solving-absurd-trolley-problems/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.dhimate.com/2022/solving-absurd-trolley-problems/</guid><description>Absurd Trolley Problems is an interesting exercise. When I started at level 1 my goal was to keep the number the deaths caused by my decisions as low as possible. But at every other level this rule of thumb wasn&amp;rsquo;t useful e.g. Killing 5 elderly people to save a baby seemed moral to me.
The one question threw me off was this.
Due to a construction error, a trolley is stuck in an eternal loop.</description></item><item><title>Finishing Clash of Clans</title><link>https://www.dhimate.com/2022/finishing-clash-of-clans/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.dhimate.com/2022/finishing-clash-of-clans/</guid><description>Today will go down in the history as a remarkable day. Approximately after 8 odd years I finished playing Clash of Clans. Upgrading that last brick of wall was a bittersweet moment.
I&amp;rsquo;m not much of a gamer. I do not own PlayStations, Wiis or such gadgets. I would rather read a book or watch a suspenseful movie than chase pixel upgrades on a tiny phone screen. But I still got hooked.</description></item><item><title>Smartlock</title><link>https://www.dhimate.com/2022/smartlock/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.dhimate.com/2022/smartlock/</guid><description>I haven&amp;rsquo;t posted in a while. At the end of last year I changed my job and joined Amazon in their Driver Experience team. We also moved to Austin. After we moved to Austin, we got an apartment with a smart lock. Our old apartment in Columbus had a more traditional mechanical lock. This smart lock came with a companion app on the phone. It uses bluetooth (and potentially WiFi) to transmit the information.</description></item><item><title>Facebook Annoyance</title><link>https://www.dhimate.com/2021/facebook-annoyance/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.dhimate.com/2021/facebook-annoyance/</guid><description>This is an interesting week for Facebook. I quit using Facebook about 8 years ago and never signed up for Instagram. I did not see any value in these services. And looking at the recent revelations by the whistleblower, I am glad that I am not on these platforms. But I (have to) use WhatsApp to stay connected with my family and friends. There is no alternative. There is strong social pressure in India that requires the use of WhatsApp.</description></item><item><title>Making Clay Ganesha At Home</title><link>https://www.dhimate.com/2021/making-clay-ganesha-at-home/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.dhimate.com/2021/making-clay-ganesha-at-home/</guid><description>This year was my second attempt to make the clay Ganesha idol at home to celebrate Ganesh Utsav. I am not much of an artist. Actually, I am afraid to draw, paint, sing, play an instrument, dance, or do any sort of work that&amp;rsquo;s considered remotely artistic in nature.
When I was in school, drawing and painting were my Achilles&amp;rsquo; heel. I would get the lowest grade possible in these subjects.</description></item><item><title>OCI Application Experience</title><link>https://www.dhimate.com/2021/oci-application/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.dhimate.com/2021/oci-application/</guid><description>The highlight of this past weekend was completing Vaidehi’s OCI application.
As soon as her passport arrived, I started working on it. The application process could’ve been so much easier, but turned out to be unnecessarily difficult.
First of all, The information is scattered across two different websites.
VFS - The visa and technology outsourcing company providing services to the Government of India OCI portal of Government of India. In more than a couple of places, the instructions are confusing and even conflicting with one another.</description></item><item><title>About Thanks for the Feedback</title><link>https://www.dhimate.com/2021/about-thanks-for-the-feedback/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.dhimate.com/2021/about-thanks-for-the-feedback/</guid><description>I received &amp;lsquo;Thanks for the Feedback &amp;rsquo; by Douglas Stone &amp;amp; Sheila Heen as an optional read for my leadership coaching program. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t very enthusiastic to read it. I didn&amp;rsquo;t have high expectations from the book. I was suspecting that it will talk about the typical annual review process at work and the kind of feedback you get from your boss. After finishing it in a few days though, I was surprised by how useful it was, not only for the feedback at the job but also in the personal relationships.</description></item><item><title>Random Act of Kindness</title><link>https://www.dhimate.com/2021/random-act-of-kindness/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.dhimate.com/2021/random-act-of-kindness/</guid><description>I frequently visit one online group. It sends some thought-provoking prompts to reflect on past experiences and random ideas.
Here are some examples.
Which bad commercial that you saw that has stayed with you? What does a &amp;lsquo;perfect day&amp;rsquo; mean to you? This week&amp;rsquo;s prompt was about the act of kindness shown to you, that you&amp;rsquo;ll never forget.
I wanted to share such experience.
Before COVID-19, I was traveling for my job.</description></item><item><title>My Audible Experience</title><link>https://www.dhimate.com/2021/my-audible-experience/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.dhimate.com/2021/my-audible-experience/</guid><description>Introduction Last month I signed up for Audible. I thought it would be great to listen to the audiobooks, instead of reading them. In the past, I had enjoyed a few audiobooks on my long road trips. I especially remember listening to George Carlin’s books. The idea of listening to books on the go, the ultimate portability, and convenience, and an opportunity to give rest to my eyes was very enticing.</description></item><item><title>Certificate of Authenticity</title><link>https://www.dhimate.com/2021/certificate-of-authenticity/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.dhimate.com/2021/certificate-of-authenticity/</guid><description>This week I got my new pair of glasses. I use photochromic lenses to help protect my eyes from the bright sunlight. These lenses turn dark when exposed to sunlight or high temperature. With this pair, my optician gave me a &amp;lsquo;Certificate of Authenticity&amp;rsquo; card from this company called &amp;lsquo;Transitions&amp;rsquo;. Transitions provide the photochromic feature in the lenses. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t aware of them. Anyway, this certificate requested that I should register my purchase.</description></item><item><title>February Quick Update</title><link>https://www.dhimate.com/2021/february-quick-update/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.dhimate.com/2021/february-quick-update/</guid><description>I haven&amp;rsquo;t posted anything in February. It was the busiest month I ever had. Our baby girl decided to arrive earlier than expected. Due to the pandemic, we decided to manage baby things on our own, without our parents. It&amp;rsquo;s fun, but for the first time parents like us, it&amp;rsquo;s not easy. The most difficult part is baby can&amp;rsquo;t talk and exactly tell us what she wants yet. So we have to decipher her crying.</description></item><item><title>Drinking Water Habit</title><link>https://www.dhimate.com/2021/drinking-water-habit/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.dhimate.com/2021/drinking-water-habit/</guid><description>I discovered that the easiest way to start drinking more water is to always keep a water bottle with me. Before going to bed, I keep a bottle of water next to the bed. The idea is, when I wake up, the first thing I see is the water bottle. I drink that bottle before getting out of bed. This system helps me get a significant headstart in meeting my daily water drinking quota.</description></item><item><title>Recap of 2020</title><link>https://www.dhimate.com/2020/recap-of-2020/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.dhimate.com/2020/recap-of-2020/</guid><description>The end of the year is the time to pause, look back, and think about how the year went by. I am very grateful and fortunate to had an opportunity to enjoy a reasonably good time in 2020.
On the personal front
We visited our families in India in January. I enjoyed meeting my parents, brother, in-laws, and friends. I did not travel for work and got more time to spend with my wife.</description></item><item><title>How Intermittent Fasting Saved My Life</title><link>https://www.dhimate.com/2020/how-intermittent-fasting-saved-my-life/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.dhimate.com/2020/how-intermittent-fasting-saved-my-life/</guid><description>One of my goals for 2020 was to stick to an intermittent fasting routine. I completed 6600 hours of fasting in 2020. On average, that&amp;rsquo;s 18 hours of fasting every day, for 365 days. Other interesting stats include the longest streak of 440 fasts and the longest fast of 37 hours. I did reasonably well to maintain a healthy weight despite stress-induced binge eating during the pandemic.
My fasting journey started in mid of 2019.</description></item></channel></rss>
