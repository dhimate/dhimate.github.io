      <description>I was talking to a C level executive the other day and he asked me to explain how does MuleSoft&amp;rsquo;s capacity/sizing and deployment model work. Given I always wear my technical hat I jumped right into the concept of cores and virtual cores and containers (and Kubernetes!) and did a pretty bad job. Fortunately that person was very accomodating and somewhat understood what I was talking about. I should&amp;rsquo;ve done better.</description>
