      <description>Introduction Last month I signed up for Audible. I thought it would be great to listen to the audiobooks, instead of reading them. In the past, I had enjoyed a few audiobooks on my long road trips. I especially remember listening to George Carlinâ€™s books. The idea of listening to books on the go, the ultimate portability, and convenience, and an opportunity to give rest to my eyes was very enticing.</description>

      <description>This week I got my new pair of glasses. I use photochromic lenses to help protect my eyes from the bright sunlight. These lenses turn dark when exposed to sunlight or high temperature. With this pair, my optician gave me a &amp;lsquo;Certificate of Authenticity&amp;rsquo; card from this company called &amp;lsquo;Transitions&amp;rsquo;. Transitions provide the photochromic feature in the lenses. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t aware of them. Anyway, this certificate requested that I should register my purchase.</description>

      <title>February Quick Update</title>

      <description>I haven&amp;rsquo;t posted anything in February. It was the busiest month I ever had. Our baby girl decided to arrive earlier than expected. Due to the pandemic, we decided to manage baby things on our own, without our parents. It&amp;rsquo;s fun, but for the first time parents like us, it&amp;rsquo;s not easy. The most difficult part is baby can&amp;rsquo;t talk and exactly tell us what she wants yet. So we have to decipher her crying.</description>

      <title>Drinking Water Habit</title>

      <description>I discovered that the easiest way to start drinking more water is to always keep a water bottle with me. Before going to bed, I keep a bottle of water next to the bed. The idea is, when I wake up, the first thing I see is the water bottle. I drink that bottle before getting out of bed. This system helps me get a significant headstart in meeting my daily water drinking quota.</description>

      <description>The end of the year is the time to pause, look back, and think about how the year went by. I am very grateful and fortunate to had an opportunity to enjoy a reasonably good time in 2020.
On the personal front
 We visited our families in India in January. I enjoyed meeting my parents, brother, in-laws, and friends. I did not travel for work and got more time to spend with my wife.</description>

      <title>How Intermittent Fasting Saved My Life</title>
      <link>https://www.dhimate.com/2020/how-intermittent-fasting-saved-my-life/</link>

      <description>One of my goals for 2020 was to stick to an intermittent fasting routine. I completed 6600 hours of fasting in 2020. On average, that&amp;rsquo;s 18 hours of fasting every day, for 365 days. Other interesting stats include the longest streak of 440 fasts and the longest fast of 37 hours. I did reasonably well to maintain a healthy weight despite stress-induced binge eating during the pandemic.
My fasting journey started in mid of 2019.</description>
