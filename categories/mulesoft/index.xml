In my opinion, it is the differentiator to allow Anypoint Platform stand apart in the crowded market of API management and integration/ESB software vendors. Unfortunately MuleSoft hasn&amp;rsquo;t paid the required attention to Anypoint Exchange since I first started using it in 2017. The newer search functionality introduced in 2020 was atrocious. Other than a few cosmetic changes around background color and support for tags, Anypoint Exchange became significantly worse for users over time.</description></item></channel></rss>
