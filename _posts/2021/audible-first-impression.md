## Introduction ##

Last month I signed up for Audible. I thought it would be great to listen to the audiobooks, instead of reading them. In the past, I had enjoyed a few audiobooks on my long road trips. I especially remember listening to George Carlin’s books. The idea of listening to books on the go, the ultimate portability, and convenience, and an opportunity to give rest to my eyes was very enticing. Audible was offering a 1-month free trial. I skimmed their huge catalog and signed up. The signup process was smooth - as you would expect from Amazon. I downloaded The Spy and the Traitor by Ben Macintyre and started listening to it. While the book was great, one of the best thrillers I enjoyed, my experience with Audible was suboptimal.


## Challenges with Audiobooks: ##
1. Audiobooks feel strange: When reading a physical or ebook, I feel like driving in daylight, with clear visibility. I can look in the rearview mirrors or outside the windows. I can notice another car approaching the intersection. If someone is overtaking I can adjust my driving. With audiobooks, I feel like someone else is driving even though I am in the driver's seat. We are traveling in the dark with only front lights. I can't look sideways or behind, as its all dark 
2. Audiobooks aren't as convenient as I would like them to be: Audiobooks need a lot of concentration. It's very easy to get distracted, tune out and miss the important part. Once you lose focus, it becomes very difficult to get back on track.
3. Audiobooks don't give the satisfaction of reading: Almost always the narrator is different. His performance is very clean and robotic. There is a constant feeling that it's not me who is reading this book. 


## Issues with Audible ##
1. Audible's subscription: When I signed up for Audiobook's trial, I thought it was like a Netflix model. I was hoping to get access to a large library of content for a low monthly price. I misunderstood. With Audible I get 1 credit to buy a book of my choice every month. Credits expire and there is pressure to buy the book to use those credits. I can buy most of the books I want, whenever I want, without an Audible subscription and still save some money. 
2. Problems with the Audible app - Audible books have DRM, so I can't listen in the app I like. I have to use the Audible app, which is okay for the most part. But my phone's aggressive battery management policy kills the app if I pause the book. This is super inconvenient. To begin listening again, I have to restart the app. 
3. Better and cheaper options available - I can borrow audiobooks for free from my local library. Their catalog is not as big as Audible's but only 2 books I wanted to read were unavailable in my library. 

I don’t think I will continue my Audible subscription for now.
