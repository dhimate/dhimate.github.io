  "readme": "Bootswatch\n==========\n\nBootswatch is a collection of free themes for [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/). Check it out at [bootswatch.com](http://bootswatch.com).\n\nUsage\n-----\nDownload the `bootstrap.min.css` file associated with a theme and replace Bootstrap's default stylesheet.\n\nThe themes are also hosted on [BootstrapCDN](http://www.bootstrapcdn.com/).\n\n Rails users should check out:\n\n* [twitter-bootswatch-rails](https://github.com/scottvrosenthal/twitter-bootswatch-rails) if using _LESS_.\n* [bootswatch-rails](https://github.com/maxim/bootswatch-rails) if using _SASS_.\n\n\nCustomization\n------\nBootswatch is open source and youâ€™re welcome to modify the themes.\n\nEach theme consists of two LESS files. `variables.less`, which is included by default in Bootstrap, allows you to customize [these settings](http://getbootstrap.com/customize/#less-variables). `bootswatch.less` introduces more extensive structural changes.\n\nThese files are also available in SASS.\n\nCheck out the [Help page](http://bootswatch.com/help/) for more details on building your own theme.\n\nAPI\n-----\n\nA simple API is available for integrating your platform with Bootswatch. Send your request to `http://api.bootswatch.com/3/`.\n\nThe swatch objects are returned in an array called `themes`, each one with the following properties:  `name`, `description`, `preview`, `thumbnail`, `css`, `cssMin`, `less`, and `lessVariables`.\n\nMore info at http://bootswatch.com/help/#api\n\nAuthor\n------\nThomas Park\n\n+ http://github.com/thomaspark\n+ http://thomaspark.co\n\nThanks\n------\n[Mark Otto](https://github.com/mdo) and [Jacob Thornton](https://github.com/fat) for [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap).\n\n[Jenil Gogari](http://www.jgog.in/) for his contributions to the Flatly theme.\n\n[James Taylor](https://github.com/jostylr) for [cors-lite](https://github.com/jostylr/cors-lite).\n\n[Corey Sewell](https://github.com/cjsewell) for SASS conversion.\n\n\nCopyright and License\n----\nCopyright 2014 Thomas Park\n\nCode released under the MIT License.\n",
